# Issue: Menu "Ghosts" In and Out at 768px Breakpoint

## Observed Behavior

At a viewport width of exactly 768px, or when resizing across this threshold, the menu appears to "ghost" in and out. This means it might animate out of view when the screen shrinks to 768px, and snap or animate back when it widens, leading to a flickering or sliding effect if the viewport width hovers around 768px.

## Root Cause

The root cause of this behavior lies in the interaction between the CSS `transform` property, the `transition` property, and the activation of the media query `@media (max-width: 768px)`.

1- **Desktop State (width > 768px):**

- The `.menu` element is displayed as a flex container `(display: flex;)`, making it visible and part of the normal document flow.
- Its `transform` property defaults to `none` (effectively, it's positioned as expected).

2- **Mobile State Trigger (width <= 768px):**

- The media query `@media (max-width: 768px)` becomes active.
- Inside this media query, the `.menu` selector is styled with:

  - `transform: translateY(-150%);` (to move it off-screen vertically)

  - `transition: .3s ease;` (which applies to all animatable properties, including transform)

3- **The "Ghosting" Animation:**

- When the viewport width changes from being greater than 768px to 768px (or less), the `transform` property of the `.menu` element changes from `none` (its desktop state) to `translateY(-150%)` (its mobile hidden state).
- Because the `transition: .3s ease;` rule is active for the `.menu` at this point, this change in the `transform` value is animated over 0.3 seconds.
- This animation—where the menu slides upwards from its visible desktop position to its hidden mobile position—is the "ghosting out" effect.
- Conversely, if the screen is widened beyond 768px, the media query styles (including the `transform` and `transition`) are removed, and the menu typically snaps back to its desktop appearance.
- If the viewport width is rapidly changed around the 768px boundary (e.g., by resizing the browser window), the menu will repeatedly animate out and snap/animate back in, creating the "ghosts in and out" effect.

The core issue is that the transition is being applied not just to the explicit open/close of the menu (via a JavaScript-toggled class like `.open`), but also to the change in state that occurs simply due to the media query activating.
